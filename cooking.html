<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Cut some white fish fillets into byte size pieces. Any white fish will work, just ensure it is very clean with no skin or bones. Sea bass, sole and flounder work well. Fish has to be fresh. Frozen fish becomes to soft and has very little taste. Squeeze several limes into a big bowl. You will need a lot of lime juice, enough for the fish to soak in. Add salt and pepper to the lime juice until it has a nice salty flavor (make it a little saltier than you normally like since some of this salt will be absorbed by the fish. Now place fish in lime juice and&nbsp;mix thoroughly. Let it sit and marinade for about an hour, then re-mix. Do this one or two more times until the fish meat is totally white (this means that the fish has fully marinated). Then cut one or two red onions into thin slices (circles or half-circles) and a little parsley or cilantro and mix them with the fish. Serve with lettuce, sliced corn on the cobb, and/or boiled sliced potatoes or yams. Goes well with chilled white wine. Enjoy!</P></FONT></BODY>
