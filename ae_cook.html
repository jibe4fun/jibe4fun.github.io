</FONT>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers"><STRONG><U>Basic
        Ceviche:</U></STRONG> Cut
    some white fish fillets into byte size pieces. Most&nbsp;sushi grade white
fish will work, just ensure it is very clean,&nbsp;fresh and has&nbsp;no skin,
dark meat, bones (frozen fish becomes to soft and has very little taste) or fishy 
    smell. Chilean&nbsp; sea bass (the best), sole and flounder work well (if the fish is good for Sushi,
it is good for Ceviche). Squeeze several limes into a big bowl. For best results use 
    key limes, but limes work fine too. Add salt and pepper to the lime juice until it has a nice salty
and peppery flavor (make it a little saltier than you normally like since some
of this salt will be absorbed by the fish). Place the fish in lime juice and&nbsp;mix
thoroughly. Let it sit and marinade for 20 m inutes to one hour, depending on how 
    raw you like the fish. In most high quality restaurants in Peru, they make the 
    ceviche when you oreder it and the fish is very raw. But if you don&#39;t like it 
    too raw you can marinade the fish in lime juice until it cooks in the lime&#39;s 
    acid (it will turn white). Stir the fish in the lime juice every few minutes. Before you serve,&nbsp;cut one or two red onions into thin
slices (circles or half-circles) and a little parsley or cilantro and mix them
with the fish. Serve with lettuce, sliced corn on the cobb, boiled or fried yuca,
and/or boiled sliced potatoes or yams. Note: in Peru the ceviche is served pretty
raw. If you like it this way marinade the fish in the lime juice no more than
30 minutes. </font></P>

</FONT><P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers"><U><STRONG>Variations:</STRONG></U>  (1)
   Mix with&nbsp;other seafood (note, some seafood like shrimp and squid has
   to be  cooked first; other seafood like scalops and clams don't need to be
   cooked; if  you would not eat it raw, then cook it); (2) Mushroom vegetarian
   ceviche:  replace fish with mushrooms, use less lime juice and add some vegetable
   oil; (3)  Try mixing fruit juices with lime juice, orange juice works well;
   (4) Try mixing  in other vegetables or fruit (e.g., cucumber chunks, celery,
   mango, pinneaples,  etc.).</font></P>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers"><U><STRONG>Tiradito:</STRONG></U> This
is the new ceviche. It is prepared like ceviche, except that the fish is cut
    in very thin slices and then marinaded for only 2 minutes or so and served
    without onions, just the plain fish. There are several versions of tiradito.
    The simplest form is plain fish marinaded in lime juice, but other versions
    have things like a hot pepper sauce or olive oil on top. You can be as creative
    as you wish with tiradito. </font></P>

<p align="center"><font color="#800000" size="2">(Potato Doe)</font></p>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">In Spanish, cause
    means &quot;cause&quot;, but this name comes from the native dialect Quechua, not
    Spanish, so I am not sure what the name means.&nbsp; Boil
    potatoes and mash them as if you were making mashed potatoes, but don't use
    any milk or butter, just the potatoes.&nbsp; Let it sit until it cools down.&nbsp; Then
  add  salt and pepper to taste, and squeeze in one or two limes until the doe
  has a  nice lemony taste.&nbsp; Once you like the taste of the doe, then add
  some  vegetable oil, not much, just enough to make the doe hold.&nbsp; It should
  look  smooth and consistent.&nbsp; You can now serve this doe by rolling little
  balls  (served as hors'deurves with a tooth pick and dip sauce), or making
  a bigger  ball (or football shape), as an appetizer with some lettuce, slice
  of hard  boiled egg and a pitted olive.&nbsp; However, the best way to eat
  this is  stuffed.&nbsp; Use anything you like to stuff it: tuna fish salad;
  egg salad;  chicken salad; boiled vegetables with a little mayonnaise; my favorite:
  a mix of  corn, tomatoes, hard boiled eggs and avocado with mayonnaise.&nbsp; How
  to stuff  it? A number of ways: (1) inter mix layers of doe and stuffing in
  a dish; (2)  make a ball with the doe, then make a big dent on it and place
  the stuffing  there; (3) my favorite: put a layer of doe in wax paper, place
  stuffing  ingredients on top, one at a time, one next to each other in lines,
  put a thin  layer of mayonnaise on top, then fold and roll the doe over the
  stuffing, then  cut the rolled doe into slices, the stuffing will look like
  a spiral in each  slice, and depending on how you arrange the ingredients it
  can be quite  colorful.&nbsp; This is a great and cool appetizer for the summer
  time.</font></P>

<P align=center><FONT color=#800000 face=Univers size=2>(Peruvian Cocktail)</P>
</FONT>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">This cocktail
    is similar to a Mexican Margarita, but a bit  stronger. First, you need to
    find Peruvian Pisco. Pisco is a hard liquor made from grapes.&nbsp;It is
    similar to Italian Grappa, but Grappa is made from the residue leftover after
    making wine, whereas Pisco is distilled from pure grapes. If you were to
distill pure wine several times you would get Pisco. Currently, Peru is producing
    highly refined pisco that is fermented from pure grapes. Some Pisco's are
    made for sipping, not Pisco Sours, and can cost upwards of $60 for a 1/2
    litter bottle (in Peru). But a pisco like this will be made from approximately
    45 pounds of grapes for one litter. </font></P>
    <P align=justify>My favorite is Pisco &quot;La Blanco&quot; (<a 
            href="http://www.piscolablanco.com.pe/">http://www.piscolablanco.com.pe</a>) 
        and the best pisco in the market is their &quot;Gran Herncia&#39; made with 45 pounds of 
        Quebranta grape per litter of Pisco produced n an artisan distillery in Ica, 
        Peru, dating back to the 1600&#39;s. It is expensive ($75 per 1/2 litter bottle) but 
        worth every penny. It would be
    a waste to use highly refined pisco for Pisco Sours. Less expensive Pisco's
    like Montesierpe or Machu Pisco would be perfectly fine for Pisco Sours. However, 
        some of the new thinking on Pisco Sours is that bad Pisco can only make bad 
        Pisco Sours and that good Pisco makes better Pisco Sours. So, many sophisticated 
        bars give you a menu of Pisco&#39;s for you to select for your Pisco Sour. You may 
        be happy paying $30 for an awesome Pisco Sour from the heavens made with La 
        Blanco Gran Herencia.&nbsp;</P>
    <P align=justify>Also, Pisco comes
    in many varieties (Mosto Verde, Italia, Moscatel, Acholado, Quebranta, Torontel, etc.).
    The best Pisco for Pisco Sours is Pisco Puro (pure pisco) from Quebranta grape, which is the strongest, 
        although today mixologists are making pisco sours with all kinds of aromatic 
        piscos made with Italia and Torontel grapes. </P>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">Many people think
    Pisco is from Chile, but it actually originated in the&nbsp;Pisco
      province of the department of Ica in Peru, which is a region with great
    production of grapes.&nbsp; While Chile
    is  producing acceptable Pisco, you will find a greater and better tasting
    variety of Piscos in Peru.&nbsp; Piscos range from very strong (Pisco puro)
    to very mild (Pisco Italia), depending on the grape used and the distillation
    process.&nbsp; 
    Pisco can be made with a single grape type (e.g., Quebranta, Torontel, Italia) 
    or can be &quot;Acholado&quot; (a blend of grapes). Mild Pisco is great for drinking straight or with juices or sodas.&nbsp; The
   best Pisco for Pisco Sour is the stronger Pisco (Pisco puro or pure 
  Pisco).&nbsp; </font></P>
    <P align=justify>One other variation in Pisco is called &quot;Mosto Verde&quot;. Normally, 
        pure grape juice is extracted (no stems, no peel, no pits, no sulfites, no 
        nothing). All sugar and water comes directly from the grape juice. The juice is 
        fermented 100% (i.e., all the juice sugar ferments into alcohol until there is 
        no sugar left). Once fermented 100% the juice (i.e., young wine) is then 
        distilled into Pisco. Mosto Verde is a variation in this process in which the 
        fermentation is stopped at 50% more or less, so that there is still some sugar 
        in the juice and then distilled. The result is a much smoother, tastier Pisco 
        that is great for sipping.</P>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">I used to recomment a 1-2-3 recipe 
    for Pisco Sour, but most popular bars now serve less sugary Pisco Sours 
    following a 1-1-3 recipe. You gotta try different amounts of sugar to find what 
    tastes better to you. Many bars today ask you for your favorite proportions and 
    they make the Pisco Sour to your taste. Here is the 1-1-3 recipe.&nbsp; </font></P>
<FONT color=#800000 face=Univers size=2></FONT><P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">1 Part lime juice<BR>
        1 Part sugar<br />
        </font>3 Parts pisco<BR>
4 Parts
   ice (you can vary this to your taste, use 3 parts for stronger Pisco Sour)
        <br />
        1 Egg white for each blender mixing</P>
    <P align=justify>There are two school of thought on how to blend this:</P>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <P align=justify>
                Some people swear by the &quot;jarabe de goma,&quot; which is simple syrup. You can&nbsp; 
                buy it in Peru, but really all you have to do is take the sugar from the recipe 
                above and mix it with one of the 4 parts of ice above, but instead of ice use 
                water. Then heat up the sugar and water until all the sugar dissolves. Let it 
                cool off and now you have your own home made Jarabe de Goma or Simple Syrup.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <P align=justify>
                Some people feel (strongly) that the genuine Pisco Sour is made with sugar, not 
                Jarabe de Goma and that dissoving sugar in water only waters down the Pisco 
                Sour.</P>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <P align=justify>
        Regardless of method, follow this blending process:</P>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <P align=justify>
                If using Jarabe de Goma, place all ingredients in the blender and blend until 
                all the ice is dissolved and the mix has a nice, foammy, milky consistency.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <P align=justify>
                If using sugar, place the sugar and Pisco in the blender and blend until all the 
                sugar is dissolved. Then add the rest of the ingredients and blend until all the 
                ice is dissolves and the mix has a nice, foammy, milky consistency.</P>
        </li>
        <li>
            <P align=justify>
                Serve. The foam will rise to the top. Then add a couple of drops of Angostura 
                Bitters (Amargo de Angostura)</P>
        </li>
    </ol>
<P align=justify>Note: 
ensure that the blender is only half full when you blend the ingredients, otherwise when the
 mix starts foaming it will spill&nbsp;over.&nbsp; Serve this foamy mix in small
  brandy or cocktail glasses and let it sit for a minute or so.&nbsp; The foam
   will rise to the top and it will look pretty cool.&nbsp; Sprinkle two drops
   of  Angostura Bitters on top.&nbsp; The Bitters gives it a nice color and
   a unique  taste.&nbsp; Many people think that the brown spots from the Bitters
    is  actually cinammon.&nbsp; The original Pisco Sour does NOT have Cinammon, but 
    Angostura Bitters.&nbsp; However, if you don&#39;t have Bitters, cinnamon tastes 
    good to, so just sprinkle a little cinnamon for color on top and, frankly, the 
    cinnamon tastes pretty good.</P>
<P align=justify><font color="#800000" size="2" face="Univers">Salud!!
    Cheers!! But please don't drive after you drink this and drink responsibly!! One
    or two Pisco Sours should be your limit. <BR>
